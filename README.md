# [Pigeon](https://github.com/pid-j)

Hi! I am Pigeon. I am Syrian ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¾ and I code stuff.

## My interests

I am interested in linguistics. I make conlangs for fun or for other things (wink-wink).
I am also interested in programming useless stuff that no one will use except for 2 people.
Mainly, Python, but I'm also beginning to learn C too.

I support Palestine ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¸
